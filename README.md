# Shopping-Cart


 [Website link](https://halilibrahimcelik.github.io/Shopping-Cart-v1.0.0/#).

My goal was to develop a real e-commerce website's checkout page for that project.
****************************
--There is a cart for buying products, and we can increase or decrease the number of products.

--By changing a parameter in the cart, our js functions calculate the cart total price. DOM, iterator, callback functions,
string-array functions and events are used in our page. 

--Additionally, I used Bootstrap  features to style my HTML code
